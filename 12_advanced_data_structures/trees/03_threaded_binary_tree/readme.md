# Threaded Binary Tree
Similar to binary tree but with a difference in storing the NULL Pointers.

In binary tree, lot of memory gets wasted to store the NULL pointers at leaf nodes.

These NULL pointers space can be used effectively to store some other information, e.g. inorder predecessor or post order predecessor information can be stored there. These special pointers are called `Threads`

There are several different ways of threading a tree.

## One-way threading
A thread will appear in the right field.
* then it will point 
* then 


## Two-Way Threading
