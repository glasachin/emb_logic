# Good Commands to remember for Networking in Linux

**Name Server Information**

Name server is required to resolve the website URLs to IP address. If there is no default then we can configure the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to give specific nameserver. Just add the line as given below:
 
```

nameserver 8.8.8.8
```


## Ping
It is used to ping any specific IP address

* If we have internet access on multiple adaptors and want to ping from specific adaptor then use the following: `ping -I <adaptor_name> <destination_address>`


## netstat



## nmcli
