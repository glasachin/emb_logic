# Rust
Rust's performance is comparable to C and C++ because it compiles directly to machine code. Developers can write low-level, highly optimized code without sacrificing safety. This makes it ideal for use cases like game engines, operating systems, embedded systems, and high-performance web services.


**Installations**

`sudo apt install curl build-essential -y`

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

`source $HOME/.cargo/env` ==> update environment

`rustc --version` ==> verify version

`sudo apt-get install rustc` ==? `rustc` is the official Rust Compiler. It converts into machine code.
