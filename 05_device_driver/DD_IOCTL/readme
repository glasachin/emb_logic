In this we create two things

1. Driver based on IOCTL operations
2. application

During learning process, we implemented one operation at a time.

IOCTL are used to configure the device driver through some application like chaning its register size, data size etc.
simple example to change these values based on the USB device connected to the USB port.

this change can be done from hardware interrupt during the device connection.

So, IOCTL is important operation to control the variety of devices.
