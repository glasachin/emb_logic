# Semaphore

In this We have modified the driver to test the synchronization technique in the driver.

Steps will be as follows:

1. Create driver and install the device.
2. Create application to read and write the device (as done for driver)
3. Run multiple read applications in different windows (run 3 applications)
4. Run write Device application in different window.
