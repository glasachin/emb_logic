# Server-Client Communication 
## Server
This will receive the communication requests from different clients

## Client
There are several clients which will send the requests to the server.
## In-Between Communication
The Communication between client and server will happen through IPC techniques.
Primarily we will be using the FIFO mechanism.

## Working
Clients will send requests for some tasks such as addition, multiplication etc. Server will check the requests and then will take the corresponding action.
