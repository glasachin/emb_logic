project Titel: Multiple Data Compression and Encryption using Iterative technique.

This project has been implemented using different techniques as follows:

1. Normal Flow: i.e. no function pointer or function pointer array has been used in this.

2. Using Function Pointer: Function pointers have been used instead of normal functions.

3. Function Pointer Array: Generic functions in the form of function pointer array are used for project implementation.
